In the world of A Song of Ice and Fire the ice dragon was a creature of legend and fear, for no man had ever tamed one. When it flew overhead, it left in its wake desolate cold and frozen land. But Adara was not afraid. For Adara was a winter child, born during the worst freeze that anyone, even the Old Ones, could remember. Adara could not remember the first time she had seen the ice dragon. It seemed that it had always been in her life, glimpsed from afar as she played in the frigid snow long after the other children had fled the cold. In her fourth year she touched it, and in her fifth year she rode upon its broad, chilled back for the first time. Then, in her seventh year, on a calm summer day, fiery dragons from the North swooped down upon the peaceful farm that was Adara\'s home. And only a winter child—and the ice dragon who loved her—could save her world from utter destruction.

In his novels and stories, in letters to editors, friends, fellow artists, and critics, in interviews and in commissioned articles on the subject, Hemingway wrote often about writing. And he wrote as well and as incisively about the subject as any writer who ever lived… This book contains Hemingway’s reflections on the nature of the writer and on elements of the writer’s life, including specific and helpful advice to writers on the craft of writing, work habits, and discipline.

ABOUT THE BOOK: Hadji Murad BY Leo Tolstoy In 1851 Leo Tolstoy enlisted in the Russian army and was sent to the Caucasus to help defeat the Chechens. During this war a great Avar chieftain, Hadji Murád, broke with the Chechen leader Shamil and fled to the Russians for safety. Months later, while attempting to rescue his family from Shamil’s prison, Hadji Murád was pursued by those he had betrayed and, after fighting the most heroic battle of his life, was killed. Hadji Murad BY Leo Tolstoy Tolstoy, witness to many of the events leading to Hadji Murád’s death, set down this story with painstaking accuracy to preserve for future generations the horror, nobility, and destruction inherent in war. Hadji Murad BY Leo Tolstoy Hadji Murat (or alternatively Hadji Murad, although the first spelling better captures the original title in Russian: Мурат [Murat]) is a novella written by Leo Tolstoy from 1896 to 1904 and published posthumously in 1912 (though not in full until 1917). The protagonist is Hadji Murat, an Avar rebel commander who, for reasons of personal revenge, forges an uneasy alliance with the Russians he has been fighting. Hadji Murad BY Leo Tolstoy ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy (Russian: Лев Николаевич Толстой; most appropriately used Liev Tolstoy; commonly Leo Tolstoy in Anglophone countries) was a Russian writer who primarily wrote novels and short stories. Later in life, he also wrote plays and essays. His two most famous works, the novels War and Peace and Anna Karenina, are acknowledged as two of the greatest novels of all time and a pinnacle of realist fiction. Many consider Tolstoy to have been one of the world\'s greatest novelists. Tolstoy is equally known for his complicated and paradoxical persona and for his extreme moralistic and ascetic views, which he adopted after a moral crisis and spiritual awakening in the 1870s, after which he also became noted as a moral thinker and social reformer. His literal interpretation of the ethical teachings of Jesus, centering on the Sermon on the Mount, caused him in later life to become a fervent Christian anarchist and anarcho-pacifist. His ideas on nonviolent resistance, expressed in such works as The Kingdom of God Is Within You, were to have a profound impact on such pivotal twentieth-century figures as Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr.', 151, '2021-01-01', '2021-12-03', 1, 16),

On Faith: “I\'m taken aback when people walk up to me and tell me they are Christians. My first response is the question \'Already?\' It seems to me a lifelong endeavor to try to live the life of a Christian. It is in the search itself that one finds ecstasy.” On Racism: “It is time for parents to teach young people early on that in diversity there is beauty and there is strength. We all should know that diversity makes for a rich tapestry, and we must understand that all the threads of the tapestry are equal in value no matter their color.” On Taking Time for Ourselves: “Each person deserves a day away in which no problems are confronted, no solutions searched for. Each of us needs to withdraw from the cares which will not withdraw from us. A day away acts as a spring tonic. It can dispel rancor, transform indecision, and renew the spirit.” On Death and Grieving: “When I sense myself filling with rage at the absence of a beloved, I try as soon as possible to remember that my concerns should be focused on what I can learn from my departed love. What legacy was left which can help me in the art of living a good life?” On Style: “Style is as unique and nontransferable and perfectly personal as a fingerprint. It is wise to take the time to develop one\'s own way of being, increasing those things one does well and eliminating the elements in one\'s character which can hinder and diminish the good personality.”', 144, '2011-11-23', '2015-11-18', 1, 5),

As the book opens, Maya, in order to support herself and her young son, gets a job in a record shop run by a white woman. Suspicious of almost any kindness shown her, she is particularly confused by the special attentions of a young white customer. Soon the relationship grows into love and then marriage, and Maya believes a permanent relationship is finally possible. But it is not to be, and she is again forced to look for work. This time she finds a job as a dancer in a sleazy San Francisco bar. Her remarkable talent, however, soon brings her attention of a different kind, and before long she is singing in one of the most popular nightclubs on the coast. From there, she is called to New York to join the cast of Porgy and Bess, which is just about to begin another tour abroad. The troupe’s joyous and dramatic adventure through Italy, France, Greece, Yugoslavia, and Egypt becomes the centerpiece of Singin’ and Swingin’. This remarkable portrayal of one of the most exciting and talented casts ever put together, and of the encounters between these larger-than-life personalities and audiences who had rarely seen black people before, makes a hilarious and poignant story. The excitement of the journey—full of camaraderie, love affairs, and memorable personalities—is dampened only by Maya\'s nagging guilt that she has once again abandoned the person she loves most in life, her son. Back home, and driven close to suicide by her guilt and concern, she takes her son with her to Hawaii, where she discovers that devotion and love, in spite of forced absence, have the power to heal and sustain. As always, Maya Angelou’s writing is charged with that remarkable sense of life and love and unique celebration of the human condition that have won her such a loyal following.', 320, '2009-04-21', '2021-08-05', 1, 30),

I have been cooking nearly all my life, so I have developed some philosophies.” Renowned and beloved author Maya Angelou returns to the kitchen—both hers and ours—with her second cookbook, filled with time-tested recipes and the intimate, autobiographical sketches of how they came to be. Inspired by Angelou’s own dramatic weight loss, the focus here is on good food, well-made and eaten in moderation. When preparing for a party, for example, Angelou says, “Remember, cooking large amounts of food does not mean that you are obligated to eat large portions.” When you create food that is full of flavor, you will find that you need less of it to feel satisfied, and you can use one dish to nourish yourself all day long. And oh, what food you will create! Savor recipes for Mixed-Up Tamale Pie, All Day and Night Cornbread, Sweet Potatoes McMillan, Braised Lamb with White Beans, and Pytt I Panna (Swedish hash.) All the delicious dishes here can be eaten in small portions, and many times a day. More important, they can be converted into other mouth-watering incarnations. So Crown Roast of Pork becomes Pork Tacos and Pork Fried Rice, while Roasted Chicken becomes Chicken Tetrazzini and Chicken Curry.

Angelou tells us about the time she was expelled from school for being afraid to speak—and her mother baked a delicious maple cake to brighten her spirits. She gives us her recipe for short ribs along with a story about a job she had as a cook at a Creole restaurant (never mind that she didn’t know how to cook and had no idea what Creole food might entail). There was the time in London when she attended a wretched dinner party full of wretched people; but all wasn’t lost—she did experience her initial taste of a savory onion tart. She recounts her very first night in her new home in Sonoma, California, when she invited M. F. K. Fisher over for cassoulet, and the evening Deca Mitford roasted a chicken when she was beyond tipsy—and created Chicken Drunkard Style. And then there was the hearty brunch Angelou made for a homesick Southerner, a meal that earned her both a job offer and a prophetic compliment: “If you can write half as good as you can cook, you are going to be famous.” Maya Angelou is renowned in her wide and generous circle of friends as a marvelous chef. Her kitchen is a social center.

This expanded second edition also includes more than sixty pages of further thoughts from Vonnegut (whose good advice wasn’t limited to graduation speeches). Edited by Dan Wakefield, and including such pieces as “How to Make Money and Find Love!,” “How to Have Something Most Billionaires Don’t,” and “Somebody Should Have Told Me Not to Join a Fraternity,” this book reads like a narrative in the unique voice that made Vonnegut a hero to readers everywhere. Hilarious, razor-sharp, freewheeling, and at times deeply serious, these reflections are ideal not just for graduates but for anyone undergoing what Vonnegut would call their “long-delayed puberty ceremony”—marking the long and challenging passage to full-time adulthood. “Like Mark Twain, Mr. Vonnegut used humor to tackle the basic questions of human existence.” —The New York Times', 169, '2016-04-05', '2022-03-23', 1, 37),

This book brings together the finest examples of his funny, strange, and moving drawings in an inexpensive, beautifully produced gift volume for every Vonnegut fan. Kurt Vonnegut\'s daughter Nanette introduces this volume of his never before published drawings with an intimate remembrance of her father. Vonnegut always drew, and many of his novels contain sketches. Breakfast of Champions (1973) included many felt-tip pen drawings, and he had a show in 1983 of his drawings at New York\'s Margo Feiden Gallery, but really got going in the early 1990s when he became acquainted with the screenprinter Joe Petro III, who became his partner in making his colorful drawings available as silkscreens. With a touch of cubism, mixed with a Paul Klee gift for caricature, a Calder-like ability to balance color and line, and more than a touch of sixties psychedelic sensibility, Vonnegut\'s aesthetic is as idiosyncratic and defiant of tradition as his books. While writing came to be more onerous in his later years, making art became his joyful primary activity, and he made drawings up until his death in 2007. This volume, and a planned touring exhibition of the drawings, will introduce Vonnegut\'s legion of fans to an entirely new side of his irrepressible creative personality.', 177, '2014-05-13', '2018-11-19', 1, 38),

Le 14 février 1989, le jour de la Saint Valentin, Salman Rushdie reçut un coup de téléphone d\'un journaliste de la BBC : il avait été \" condamné à mort \" par l\'Ayatollah Khomeiny. C\'était la première fois qu\'il entendait le mot \" fatwa \". Son crime ? Avoir écrit Les Versets sataniques, un roman accusé d\'être \" contre l\'Islam, le Prophète et le Coran \". Ainsi commence l\'extraordinaire histoire d\'un écrivain obligé de devenir un clandestin, changeant sans cesse de domicile, sous la protection permanente d\'une équipe de protection policière armée. Quand on lui demande de se choisir un pseudonyme à destination de la police, il songe aux écrivains qu\'il aime et essaie des combinaisons de leurs noms ; puis l\'idée lui vient : Conrad et Tchekov – Joseph Anton. Comment un écrivain et sa famille traversent-ils neuf années sous une menace de meurtre perpétuelle ? Comment continuer à écrire ? À vivre des histoires d\'amour ? Quels effets le désespoir a-t-il sur sa pensée et son action, comment et pourquoi flanche-t-il et comment apprend-il à se relever et à se battre ?

C\'est un livre d\'une franchise et d\'une honnêteté exceptionnelles, saisissant, provocant, émouvant, et d\'une importance vitale.

P. Lovecraft. Despite this nearly unprecedented posthumous trajectory, at the time of his death at the age of forty-six, Lovecraft\'s work had appeared only in dime-store magazines, ignored by the public and maligned by critics. Now well over a century after his birth, Lovecraft is increasingly being recognized as the foundation for American horror and science fiction, the source of \"incalculable influence on succeeding generations of writers of horror fiction\" (Joyce Carol Oates). In this volume, Leslie S. Klinger reanimates Lovecraft with clarity and historical insight, charting the rise of the erstwhile pulp writer, whose rediscovery and reclamation into the literary canon can be compared only to that of Poe or Melville. Weaving together a broad base of existing scholarship with his own original insights, Klinger appends Lovecraft\'s uncanny oeuvre and Kafkaesque life story in a way that provides context and unlocks many of the secrets of his often cryptic body of work. Over the course of his career, Lovecraft—\"the Copernicus of the horror story\" (Fritz Leiber)—made a marked departure from the gothic style of his predecessors that focused mostly on ghosts, ghouls, and witches, instead crafting a vast mythos in which humanity is but a blissfully unaware speck in a cosmos shared by vast and ancient alien beings. One of the progenitors of \"weird fiction,\" Lovecraft wrote stories suggesting that we share not just our reality but our planet, and even a common ancestry, with unspeakable, godlike creatures just one accidental revelation away from emerging from their epoch of hibernation and extinguishing both our individual sanity and entire civilization. Following his best-selling The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes, Leslie S. Klinger collects here twenty-two of Lovecraft\'s best, most chilling \"Arkham\" tales, including \"The Call of Cthulhu,\" At the Mountains of Madness, \"The Whisperer in Darkness,\" \"The Shadow Over Innsmouth,\" \"The Colour Out of Space,\" and others. With nearly 300 illustrations, including full-color reproductions of the original artwork and covers from Weird Tales and Astounding Stories, and more than 1,000 annotations, this volume illuminates every dimension of H.

Hijas de una misma madre y de padres pertenecientes a dos etnias distintas, Effia y Esi son dos hermanas de sangre que nunca llegarán a conocerse. Sus caminos están irremediablemente destinados a separarse: así, mientras Effia es obligada a casarse con un gobernador inglés y a residir en una fortaleza junto a la costa, Esi es capturada y enviada como esclava al sur de Estados Unidos. La narración va trazando, pues, el devenir de las dos ramas de la familia, protagonistas de conmovedoras historias de aflicción, esperanza y superación en el marco de una serie de relevantes acontecimientos históricos: las guerras tribales, el negocio del cacao, la llegada de los misioneros, la Ley de Esclavos Fugitivos de 1850, la Gran Migración Negra, la lucha por los derechos civiles y el renacimiento de Harlem en los años veinte, hasta llegar a la epidemia de heroína de los setenta. Recibida con entusiasmo desbordante en Norteamérica, Inglaterra y Francia, la crítica especializada de ambos lados del Atlántico celebró la llegada de una voz nueva, límpida y potente, dotada de un especial talento para acercar al lector el microcosmos de los sentimientos más íntimos del individuo en su desigual lucha ante la aplastante fuerza de la Historia. Una lectura apasionante, diríamos irrenunciable, que sirve de carta de presentación de una nueva generación de autores de origen africano que, sin duda, dejada huella en la literatura de este siglo. Reseñas: «Hay libros buenos, libros hermosos y luego están los grandes libros. Hay libros que emocionan y educan, y luego están los que son menos habituales, los valiosos, los que tienen la fuerza de cambiar nuestra forma de entender la complejidad de este mundo extraño. Volver a casa pertenece a esa segunda categoría.» -Lire «Trazar tres siglos en cuatrocientas páginas era una apuesta arriesgada y podría haber terminado en una novela didáctica o insulsa. Pero no ha sido así: Gyasi ha logrado esta proeza gracias a una inteligente combinación de política e intimismo, historia y magia, y a unas imágenes con un gran poder evocador.» - Le Monde «La esclavitud es una herida abierta: nunca sanará. Y como tal, ha proporcionado una reserva inagotable de material para narradores, un pozo sin fondo de giros trágicos, traiciones épicas, trascendencias inesperadas y secretos desconocidos. [...] En ese mismo pozo de agua turbia se ha sumergido Yaa Gyasi, escritora novel de origen ghanés-americano, para crear Volver a casa, un retrato valiente del papel que desempeñó África occidental en el comercio transatlántico de personas.» -The Guardian «Necesitaba leer un libro como éste para recordar de lo que uno es capaz.

Written with tremendous sweep and power, Homegoing traces the generations of family who follow, as their destinies lead them through two continents and three hundred years of history, each life indeliably drawn, as the legacy of slavery is fully revealed in light of the present day. Effia and Esi are born into different villages in eighteenth-century Ghana. Effia is married off to an Englishman and lives in comfort in the palatial rooms of Cape Coast Castle. Unbeknownst to Effia, her sister, Esi, is imprisoned beneath her in the castle’s dungeons, sold with thousands of others into the Gold Coast’s booming slave trade, and shipped off to America, where her children and grandchildren will be raised in slavery. One thread of Homegoing follows Effia’s descendants through centuries of warfare in Ghana, as the Fante and Asante nations wrestle with the slave trade and British colonization. The other thread follows Esi and her children into America. From the plantations of the South to the Civil War and the Great Migration, from the coal mines of Pratt City, Alabama, to the jazz clubs and dope houses of twentieth-century Harlem, right up through the present day, Homegoing makes history visceral, and captures, with singular and stunning immediacy, how the memory of captivity came to be inscribed in the soul of a nation.', 0, '2019-10-31', '2020-02-06', 3, 3),

Truly an amazement—and a great gift for its readers. When four classmates from a small Massachusetts college move to New York to make their way, they\'re broke, adrift, and buoyed only by their friendship and ambition.

Over the decades, their relationships deepen and darken, tinged by addiction, success, and pride. Yet their greatest challenge, each comes to realize, is Jude himself, by midlife a terrifyingly talented litigator yet an increasingly broken man, his mind and body scarred by an unspeakable childhood, and haunted by what he fears is a degree of trauma that he’ll not only be unable to overcome—but that will define his life forever.

So here we are. My name was Eileen Dunlop. Now you know me. I was twenty-four years old then, and had a job that paid fifty-seven dollars a week as a kind of secretary at a private juvenile correctional facility for teenage boys. I think of it now as what it really was for all intents and purposes—a prison for boys. I will call it Moorehead. Delvin Moorehead was a terrible landlord I had years later, and so to use his name for such a place feels appropriate. In a week, I would run away from home and never go back. This is the story of how I disappeared. The Christmas season offers little cheer for Eileen Dunlop, an unassuming yet disturbed young woman trapped between her role as her alcoholic father’s caretaker in a home whose squalor is the talk of the neighborhood and a day job as a secretary at the boys’ prison, filled with its own quotidian horrors. Consumed by resentment and self-loathing, Eileen tempers her dreary days with perverse fantasies and dreams of escaping to the big city. In the meantime, she fills her nights and weekends with shoplifting, stalking a buff prison guard named Randy, and cleaning up her increasingly deranged father’s messes. When the bright, beautiful, and cheery Rebecca Saint John arrives on the scene as the new counselor at Moorehead, Eileen is enchanted and proves unable to resist what appears at first to be a miraculously budding friendship. In a Hitchcockian twist, her affection for Rebecca ultimately pulls her into complicity in a crime that surpasses her wildest imaginings. Played out against the snowy landscape of coastal New England in the days leading up to Christmas, young Eileen’s story is told from the gimlet-eyed perspective of the now much older narrator.

Nadie sabrá nunca quién la mató. No fui yo. Este es su cadáver.» Pero junto a la nota no hay ningún cadáver. Vesta Gul, que acaba de mudarse tras la muerte de su marido y no conoce a nadie en su nuevo hogar, no sabe muy bien qué hacer con esta información. Comienza a obsesionarse con la figura de Magda y a elucubrar con las diversas maneras en que pudieron asesinarla, si es que efectivamente ocurrió tal cosa. Su aislamiento la conduce a una serie de ideas que comienzan a encontrar un reflejo en la vida real. De un modo emocionante y terrorífico, las piezas parecen encajar: a encajar entre sí y con las zonas más oscuras de su propio pasado. Solo hay dos opciones para resolver este misterio: una explicación banal e inocente o una causa profundamente siniestra. La crítica ha dicho... «Moshfegh se ha tomado la molestia de estirar los bordes del género y entrar y salir de él con comodidad.

Cuando era una joven aspirante a escritora, Carmen Maria Machado conoció a una chica menuda, rubia, de clase alta, licenciada en Harvard, sofisticada y fascinante con la que inició su primera relación lésbica, después de varias experiencias sexuales con hombres. La chica poseía una idílica cabaña en Bloomington, Virginia: la casa de los sueños del título. Pero los sueños se convirtieron en pesadillas cuando la novia de Machado empezó a mostrarse celosa, controladora y paranoica, para luego acusarla de engañarla con todo el mundo y acabar agrediéndola verbal e incluso físicamente. Este libro es el testimonio de una relación tóxica, que en este caso no tiene como agresor a un varón heterosexual de mentalidad patriarcal y machista, sino a una lesbiana. Y este es un primer elemento que da valor al texto: la denuncia de la violencia en la pareja dentro de la comunidad queer. Pero la calidad excepcional de la propuesta de Machado va más allá: en lugar de quedarse en un mero ejercicio de testimonio personal, utiliza la historia vivida –y sufrida– para explorar más a fondo el tema, jugando literariamente con él.

Tracing the full arc of a harrowing relationship with a charismatic but volatile woman, Machado struggles to make sense of how what happened to her shaped the person she was becoming. And it’s that struggle that gives the book its original structure: each chapter is driven by its own narrative trope—the haunted house, erotica, the bildungsroman—through which Machado holds the events up to the light and examines them from different angles. She looks back at her religious adolescence, unpacks the stereotype of lesbian relationships as safe and utopian, and widens the view with essayistic explorations of the history and reality of abuse in queer relationships. Machado’s dire narrative is leavened with her characteristic wit, playfulness, and openness to inquiry.

Bestseller del New York Times. Generación tras generación, la comunidad negra del pueblo de Mallard, en Luisiana, ha intentado aclarar el tono de su piel favoreciendo los matrimonios mixtos. Las inseparables gemelas Desirée y Stella Vignes, con su color níveo, sus ojos castaños y su cabello ondulado, son un buen ejemplo de ello. Tan distintas y tan iguales, decidieron huir juntas del diminuto pueblo creyendo que también podrían escapar de su sangre. Años después y ante la mirada atónita de todos, Desireé regresa acompañada de una niña negra como el carbón. Hace tiempo que no sabe nada de Stella, después de que decidiera desaparecer y renunciar definitivamente a sus orígenes para vivir otra vida como mujer de raza blanca. Aclamada como la digna heredera de Toni Morrison y James Baldwin, Brit Bennett es una de las grandes revelaciones de la literatura afroamericana de los últimos tiempos. ENGLISH DESCRIPTION #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER ONE OF BARACK OBAMA\'S FAVORITE BOOKS OF 2020 NAMED A BEST BOOK OF 2020 BY THE NEW YORK TIMES * THE WASHINGTON POST * NPR * PEOPLE * TIME MAGAZINE* VANITY FAIR * GLAMOUR “Bennett’s tone and style recalls James Baldwin and Jacqueline Woodson, but it’s especially reminiscent of Toni Morrison’s 1970 debut novel, The Bluest Eye.” —Kiley Reid, Wall Street Journal “A story of absolute, universal timelessness …For any era, it\'s an accomplished, affecting novel. For this moment, it\'s piercing, subtly wending its way toward questions about who we are and who we want to be….” –Entertainment Weekly From The New York Times-bestselling author of The Mothers, a stunning new novel about twin sisters, inseparable as children, who ultimately choose to live in two very different worlds, one black and one white. The Vignes twin sisters will always be identical. But after growing up together in a small, southern black community and running away at age sixteen, it\'s not just the shape of their daily lives that is different as adults, it\'s everything: their families, their communities, their racial identities. Many years later, one sister lives with her black daughter in the same southern town she once tried to escape. The other secretly passes for white, and her white husband knows nothing of her past. Still, even separated by so many miles and just as many lies, the fates of the twins remain intertwined. What will happen to the next generation, when their own daughters\' storylines intersect? Weaving together multiple strands and generations of this family, from the Deep South to California, from the 1950s to the 1990s, Brit Bennett produces a story that is at once a riveting, emotional family story and a brilliant exploration of the American history of passing. Looking well beyond issues of race, The Vanishing Half considers the lasting influence of the past as it shapes a person\'s decisions, desires, and expectations, and explores some of the multiple reasons and realms in which people sometimes feel pulled to live as something other than their origins. As with her New York Times-bestselling debut The Mothers, Brit Bennett offers an engrossing page-turner about family and relationships that is immersive and provocative, compassionate and wise.', 0, '2021-06-22', '2022-08-28', 3, 3),
